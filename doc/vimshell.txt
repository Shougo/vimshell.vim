==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION						*vimshell-introduction*

Vimshell is an extreme shell that doesn't depend on external shells but is
written completely in pure Vim script. To be honest the implementation is not
as mature as eshell yet. The most important characteristic of vimshell is that
it can collaborate with other Vim plugins. Additionally, for example, vimshell
also works on Windows where there are no good shells at all; note that you
cannot use full set of vimshell features on Windows though. Furthermore,
vimshell borrowed handy functionalities from other shells. Vimshell has
built-in functionalities that you had to set up to enable if it's on zsh.

Vimshell doesn't pursue being completely compatible with average shells but
aims to be a handy shell, so some behaviours like the rule of variables are a
little bit different to them.

==============================================================================
USAGE						*vimshell-usage*

You can start vimshell in ":VimShell", or use helpful keymap already defined.
Because vimshell works similar with a common shell, you may operate it
intuitively. But vimshell performs the path appointment in '/'.
Vimshell fails to recognize escape sequences when you use '\' on Windows
for a path and does not work.

vimshell reads .vimshrc as initialize file.
It might be helpful to add alias configurations.

Note: vimshell has nothing to do with bash or zsh, so as to have no
compatiblities.  vimshell doesn't read .bashrc or .zshrc, but environment
variables by "vimshell-internal-source".

==============================================================================
INSTALL						*vimshell-install*

vimshell needs |vimproc|
http://github.com/Shougo/vimproc

You must install and compile vimproc Ver.5.0(or later) before use vimshell
(refer to |vimproc-install|).

Note: To enable complete feature, required neocomplcache.
https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache

INTERFACE					*vimshell-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS 					*vimshell-commands*

:VimShell [{options}...] [{path}]		*:VimShell*
		Runs vimshell. The {path} will be its current directory.
		If aother vimshell buffer exists, switches to the vimshell
		buffer and changes its current directory to {path}.
		If you omit {path}, it uses Vim's current directory (or does not
		change the current directory).

						*vimshell-options*
		{options} are options for a vimshell buffer.  You may give the
		following parameters for a option; you must escape with \ when
		it contains spaces.

						*vimshell-options-buffer-name*
		-buffer-name={buffer-name}
		Specifies a buffer name. The default buffer name is 'default'.
		Note: Buffer name must not contain spaces.

						*vimshell-options-toggle*
		-toggle
		Close vimshell buffer window if this vimshell buffer name
		window is exists.

						*vimshell-options-create*
		-create
		Create new vimshell buffer.

						*vimshell-options-split*
		-split
		Split vimshell buffer window. |vimshell-options-split-command|
		is used.

						*vimshell-options-popup*
		-popup
		Popup split vimshell buffer window.
		|vimshell-options-split-command| is used.

						*vimshell-options-split-command*
		-split-command={command-name}
		Specify split command.

						*vimshell-options-prompt*
		-prompt={prompt}
		Specify prompt string. If omit it,
		|g:vimshell_prompt| is used.

						*vimshell-options-secondary-prompt*
		-secondary-prompt={secondary-prompt}
		Specify secondary prompt string. If omit it,
		|g:vimshell_secondary_prompt| is used.

						*vimshell-options-user-prompt*
		-user-prompt={user-prompt}
		Specify secondary prompt string. If omit it,
		|g:vimshell_user_prompt| is used.

						*vimshell-options-right-prompt*
		-right-prompt={right-prompt}
		Specify right prompt string. If omit it,
		|g:vimshell_right_prompt| is used.

:VimShellCreate [{options}...] [{path}]		*:VimShellCreate*
		Runs vimshell as the same :VimShell, but it creates a new
		vimshell buffer instead of activating other vimshells which are
		up and runnig.

:VimShellTab [{options}...] [{path}]		*:VimShellTab*
		It's same as |:VimShellCreate|, but creates a new tab.

:VimShellPop [{options}...] [{path}]		*:VimShellPop*
		Like as |:VimShell|, but this command popups little window.  It
		will be your help when you want to make vimshell a bit help.
		To split it, |g:vimshell_popup_command| is suited command.
		When you are in vimshell buffer, it closes the buffer.

:VimShellCurrentDir [{options}...] [{path}]	*:VimShellCurrentDir*
		Like as |:VimShell|, but move to current directory.

:VimShellBufferDir [{options}...] [{path}]	*:VimShellBufferDir*
		Like as |:VimShell|, but move to buffer's dirrectory.

:VimShellExecute {command}			*:VimShellExecute*
		It does not run vimshell, but launches a terminal program you
		Specify by {command}, and this program runs in background.
		You can use vimshell like as GNU screen.

:VimShellInteractive [{command}]		*:VimShellInteractive*
		It does not run vimshell, but launches a interpreter program
		you specify by {command}.  It is same as Emacs's M-x
		{interpreter-name}.  You leave out {command}, vimshell uses
		the value in |g:vimshell_interactive_interpreter_commands|.

		Resize window example:
>
		VimShellInteractive --split='split | resize 20' irb
<
:VimShellTerminal {command}			*:VimShellTerminal*
		It does not run vimshell, but same as Emacs's ansi-term,
		it launches a terminal program you Specify by {command}.
		Note: This is not completed function.

:[range]VimShellSendString {string}		*:VimShellSendString*
		It sends selected string to the interpreter in background
		buffer of vimshell, iexe, texe.  You can control interpreter
		as if you are using |quickrun|.
		Cf: |vimshell#interactive#send_string()|
		Note: If interpreter is not loaded in current tab, you can run
		interpreter command.

:VimShellSendBuffer {bufname}			*:VimShellSendBuffer*
		Sets background buffer as {bufname}.  When {bufname} isn't
		showed, it will be opened automatically.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		Sets vimshell default secondary prompt string. Initial value is
		"%%".

g:vimshell_user_prompt				*g:vimshell_user_prompt*
		You can define additional prompt to substitute a string for
		this.  Unlike |g:vimshell_prompt|, it can be a non-fixed
		string.  You can get multi-line prompt by seperating "user
		prompt" with \n.

		This example will be helpful to show current directory
		everytime.
>
		let g:vimshell_user_prompt = 'getcwd()'
<
g:vimshell_right_prompt				*g:vimshell_right_prompt*
		It's zsh-like right prompt. This value is a string value which

INTERNAL COMMANDS					*vimshell-internal-commands*

The internal commands are internal commands in other shells.  The arguments are
split by vimshell.

Note: The internal commands do not supports pipeline.

commands will be freeze.
>
		vimshell% echo hello | vim
<
bg [{option}...] {command}				*vimshell-internal-bg*
		Opens new buffer and executes {command} by background.
		Execute external command forcibly.  You can not input to
		{command}.
		If you press <C-c> in background buffer, kill {command}
		execution.
		Note: "command &" equals to "bg command"
>
		vimshell% ls&
<
		Note: iexe, exe, bg, texe and less interpret options changes
		the behavior. Refer to |vimshell-execute-options|.
		
		--filetype={filetype-name}
		Changes output buffer 'filetype' to {filetype-name}.
		If omit the option, filetype will be set "background".

whereis {command}				*vimshell-internal-whereis*
		Print {command} by full path.

==============================================================================
SPECIAL COMMANDS					*vimshell-special-commands*
Special command is minimum parsed by vimshell. So, you can parse arguments in
special commands. But parsing is difficult.

alias {alias-name} = {command}				*vimshell-special-alias*
		Defines alias. Vimshell replaces {alias-name} as {command}.
		Differnt from other shells, "=" with spaces is valid.
		
		The alias can take arguments. To get arguments, use $$args
		variable.
>
		vimshell% alias echo=':echo "$$args"'
		vimshell% alias echo2=':echo "$$args[1]"'
		vimshell% alias echo3=':echo "$$args[2:]"'
<
galias {global-alias-name} = {command}			*vimshell-internal-galias*
		Defines global alias. Vimshell replaces {global-alias-name} as {command}.
		Differnt from |vimshell-special-alias|, global alias in
		arguments is expanded. This feature is like to zsh global alias.
		
		Note: Global alias with pipes is not supported.
>
		vimshell% galias G = '|grep'
		vimshell% ls G hoge
<
let ${var-name} = {expression}				*vimshell-special-let*
		Assigns {expression} to {var-name}.
		You must add prefix "$" in {var-name} head.
		Note: Shell variable is vimshell buffer local.
		
		To assign to environment variables, Capitalize variable name
		head.
>
		vimshell% let $Hoge = $hoge
<
		Differnt from other shells, "=" with spaces is valid.
		The {expression} is Vim script expression.
		But, you must add prefix "$" in variable name head.
		Executed status is write in "$$status".
		The prefix "$$" means vimshell internal variables.

sexe {command}						*vimshell-special-sexe*
		Execute {command} in 'shell'. If the command is wrong in
		vimshell, you can use this command.
		Note: Must be set 'shell' and shell options.
		Note: In windows, appears DOS window.

vexe {expression}					*vimshell-special-vexe*
		Execute {expression} as Vim script statement and prints outputs.
		Note: After execute command, must return vimshell buffer.
		
		You can use prefix ":" instead of vexe.
		Note: If you use ":", vimshell do not parse anything.
		
		Example:
>
		:ls
<
==============================================================================
ALTER COMMAND						*vimshell-alter-command*

Vimshell supports altercmd. Altercmd is like abbrev alias.
Original altercmd plugin is here: [http://github.com/kana/vim-altercmd]

To use altercmd, call |vimshell#altercmd#define|function in vimshell buffer.
Usually, used in autocmd FileType.
>
	autocmd FileType vimshell
	\ call vimshell#altercmd#define('g', 'git')
<
==============================================================================
HOOK							*vimshell-hook*

Vimshell has not function feature, but can call hook function in hook points.
So If you learned Vim script and vimshell, customizable vimshell.

Next examples set hook in "chpwd". This hook execute ls internal command when
current directory is changed.
>
	autocmd FileType vimshell
	\ call vimshell#hook#add('chpwd', 'my_chpwd', 'g:my_chpwd')
	
	function! g:my_chpwd(args, context)
		call vimshell#execute('ls')
	endfunction
<
Default hook points are below. Hook functions arguments are {args} and {context}.
{args} is arguments list, {context} is context information.
But some functions arguments is {cmdline}.

chpwd							*vimshell-hook-chpwd*
		This hook called when changed vimshell current directory.
		The first argument is new current directory.

preparse						*vimshell-hook-preparse*
		This hook called when before parse command line.
		The first argument is {cmdline}. {cmdline} is command line string.
		And returns changed command line string.

preexec							*vimshell-hook-preexec*
		This hook called when after alias parsed and before execute
		command line.
		The first argument is {cmdline}. {cmdline} is command line string.
		And returns changed command line string.

postexec						*vimshell-hook-postexec*
		This hook called when after execute command line.
		The first argument is {cmdline}. {cmdline} is executed command
		line string.

emptycmd						*vimshell-hook-emptycmd*
		This hook called when cmdline is empty.
		The first argument is {cmdline}. {cmdline} is command line string.
		And returns changed command line string.

notfound						*vimshell-hook-notfound*
		This hook called when the command is not found.
		The first argument is {cmdline}. {cmdline} is command line string.
		And returns changed command line string.

preprompt						*vimshell-hook-preprompt*
		This hook called when after execute command line and before
		display prompt.

preinput						*vimshell-hook-preinput*
		This hook called when after user input.
		The first argument is {input}. {input} is user input string.
		And returns changed input string.
		Note: This hook is usually used in interactive buffer.

postinput						*vimshell-hook-postinput*
		This hook called when after executed user input.
		The first argument is {input}. {input} is user input string.
		Note: This hook is usually used in interactive buffer.

To analyze command line, use |vimproc#parser#split_args()|or
|vimproc#parser#split_args_through()|. These functions arguments are the
command line string. |vimproc#parser#split_args()| evals quoted string, but
|vimproc#parser#split_args_through()| remains quoted string.
Note: These functions do not analyze ";", "&&", "||", pipes and redirection.

==============================================================================
TIPS							*vimshell-tips*

directory stack						*vimshell-tips-directory-stack*
		Vimshell supports directory stack like bash or zsh. And
		auto_pushd automatically.  So, pushd command does not exist.
		To view directory stack, use |vimshell-internal-dirs|.
		To cd from directory stack, use |vimshell-internal-popd|.
		"cd -" is also supported.

auto_cd							*vimshell-tips-auto_cd*
		Vimshell supports auto_cd like zsh. If you execute with a
		directory name, vimshell moves to the current directory.
		Note: The setting is nothing.

block							*vimshell-tips-block*
		Vimshell supports Block.
>
		vimshell% echo /hoge/piyo/{hoge,hogera}
		-> /hoge/piyo/hoge /hoge/piyo/hogera
<
		And supports expanding numbers feature.
>
		vimshell% echo {00..09}
		-> 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09
<
wild card						*vimshell-tips-wildcard*
		Vimshell supports wildcard. If wildcard files are not found,
		an error is occured.
>
		vimshell% ls *.htm
<
		Ignore pattern is supported.
>
		vimshell% ls *~*.htm
<
backquote						*vimshell-tips-backquote*
		You can use command output as arguments.
>
		vimshell% echo `ls`
<
		And embed Vim script expression.
>
		vimshell% echo `=3`
<
fakecygpty						*vimshell-tips-fakecygpty*
		fakecygpty connects Windows pipes to Cygwin pty.
		Note: This command is only on Windows.
		Following command is to connect to Cygwin ssh command.
>
		> fakecygpty ssh
<
		fakecygpty original source code is in Meadow. But I distribute
		the source.
		http://github.com/Shougo/fakecygpty
		To compile the source code, execute the command below.
>
		$ gcc fakecygpty.c -o fakecygpty.exe
<
		And put fakecygpty command in $PATH directory.
>
encoding					*vimshell-tips-encoding*
		If you set 'encoding' manually on Windows environment,
		multibyte characters may be broken.
		But some commands on Windows are using "utf8" characters.
		If you use that commands, use command "--encoding" option.
>
		vimshell% iexe --encoding=utf8 ghci
<
environment-variables-execution
			*vimshell-tips-environment-variables-execution*
		To execute commands with changing environment variables like
		sh's "env=value command" syntax, you can use "env" command.
		Example:
>
		:call vimproc#system('env GIT_EDITOR= git commit')
<
==============================================================================
UNITE SOURCES						*vimshell-unite-sources*

						*vimshell-unite-source-vimshell-history*
vimshell/history
		Nominates vimshell histories as candidates. This source is also
		available in interactive buffer. This source is used in
		|unite#sources#vimshell_history#start_complete()|.
		Note: Default mapping is <C-l>.
		
		Exmaple:
>
		inoremap <buffer> <expr><silent> <C-l>  unite#sources#vimshell_history#start_complete()
<
						*vimshell-unite-source-vimshell-external_history*
vimshell/external_history
		Nominates external shell histories as candidates. This source is also
		available in interactive buffer. This source is used in
		|unite#sources#vimshell_history#start_complete()|.
		Note: Edit histories is invalid.
		Vimshell searches external history path from $SHELL
		automatically.  You can set external history path
		|g:unite_source_vimshell_external_history_path|.

kind actions:

vimshell/history					*vimshell-unite-action-vimshell-history*
	execute		Execute history.
			If you selected several histories, "; " will be inserted.
	edit		Edit history.
	delete		Delete history.

==============================================================================
CREATE PLUGIN						*vimshell-create-plugin*

In this clause, I comment on a method to make plugin of vimshell.  The
ability of vimshell will spread by creating plugin by yourself.

==============================================================================
